Aigonix Studio is your management-tool to interact with services and products you run in the Dolittle Platform. It is a web-based application that is available at [dolittle.studio](https://dolittle.studio).

In Studio you can create and manage Applications, Environments, Microservices and other products and services.

## Getting started

To access Studio you need to be a customer of Aigonix. If you are not a customer, you can [contact us](https://dolittle.com/contact) to learn more and hopefully become one.

Once you have access to Studio, you can log in using your credentials at [dolittle.studio](https://dolittle.studio). You can now create your first Application and start deploying your Microservices into that application.
