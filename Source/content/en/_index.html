{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-bell" title="Event Driven" %}}
Our approach to system/application design is based using business events - meaning anything that happens that provides value to your business, like a notification or state change. We make it easy to use this advanced architectural pattern by taking care of the streaming, storing and transfer of events between the services you make. You just make the business logic.
