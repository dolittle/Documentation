The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

Writing documentation can be done by just working on each repository individually or you can work with the documentation
engine and see the end result while working. This is a good idea to get a feeling for how it will look like and verify
that links, images and diagrams are correct.

You'll have to start by cloning the Documentation repository, which has sub modules:

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/dolittle/documentation
```

If you've already cloned it, you can get the submodules by doing the following:

```shell
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The system is relying on all content sitting in the `content` folder:

```
<repository root>
└── Source
    └── Hugo
        └── content
```

Its expecting a folder for each top-level repository and the content of the `Documentation` folder directly in this.
This is best achieved by creating a symbolic link to the repositories `Documentation` folder.
Open a shell and navigate to the `content` folder.

Unix:
```shell
$ ln -s <repository-folder>/Documentation <folder-name>
```

Windows:
```shell
c:> mklink /d <repository-folder>\Documentation <folder-name>
```

Example:

Unix:
```shell
$ ln -s /Projects/Dolittle/Runtime/Documentation Overview
```

Windows:
```shell
c:> mklink /d c:\Projects\Dolittle\Runtime\Documentation Overview
```

Chances are you are contributing to the code of the repository and you can therefor leave it in place and maintain
code and documentation side-by-side.

### Building and running


#### Install dependencies
You need to install node dependencies in the `Source/Hugo` folder. You can do this through using npm or yarn.

NPM:
```shell
$ npm install
```

Yarn:
```shell
$ yarn
```


#### Install Hugo
You will need to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).
Once you have Hugo installed, you open a shell and navigate to the `Source/Hugo` folder.
From this you simply do:

Unix:
```shell
$ hugo server
```

Windows:
```shell
c:> hugo server
```
This should then yield something like the following:

```shell
                   | EN
+------------------+-----+
  Pages            | 191
  Paginator pages  |   0
  Non-page files   |  32
  Static files     | 209
  Processed images |   0
  Aliases          |   2
  Sitemaps         |   1
  Cleaned          |   0

```

It is now a matter of opening up a browser to the URL `http://localhost:1313` and start writing documentation.
With the default option, the page will live reload when saving any files.

## Writing

All documentation is written in markdown following the [GitHub flavor](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
Markdown can be written using the simplest of editors (Pico, Nano, Notepad), but there are editors out there that gives
great value and guides you through giving you feedback on errors. Editors like [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/)
and [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com) comes highly recommended. VSCode has for instance a [markdown preview feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown).
